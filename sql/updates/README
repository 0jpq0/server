NOTE: This is file special addition for mangos-0.12 branch 
      It describe work with backported sql updates

== Database Updates ==
This folder contains SQL files which will apply required updates to your MySQL
database, whenever the MaNGOS database structure has been changed or extended.

To see if you need an update, the file names have been given a fixed structure
that should enable you to see if you need an update or not.

=== File name descriptin ===
File names are divided into two parts. First part is the order_number+revision+counter
that show commit revision that will be compatible with database after apply update.
Counter set order in sql updates apply for same revision. Order_number set global order in directory 
for backported sql updates (its backported in random order and need special mangos-0.12 side order for apply).
The second part of the name of the database and the table that needs and update or has been added.
See an example below:

         001_6939_01_mangos_quest_template.sql
         |   |    |  |      |
         |   |    |  |      |
         |   |    |  |      The table `spell_chain`
         |   |    |  |      will need an update.
         |   |    |  |
         |   |    |  Name of affected DB (default recommended name)
         |   |    |  Can be: characters, mangos, realmd
         |   |    |
         |   |    Counter show number of sql update in master updates list for provided master revision
         |   |    and set proper order for sql updates for same revision
         |   |
         |   MaNGOS master commit revison related to sql update. 
         |   It included in commit description in form [6936] as you can see at http://github.com/mangos/mangos/commits/mangos-0.12
         |
         Order_number set special order for apply sql updates from different backported revisions in mangos-0.12 branch

After appling this update DB compatiable with database that include this sql update.
SQL update can include special protection against multiply and wrong order SQL updates apply.
So attempt apply sql update to more old DB without previous SQL update in list for targeted database
or to DB with already applied this or later SQL update will generate error and not applied.

=== For commiters ====

DO NOT use git_id tool for mangos-0.12 branch or any branch different from master.

If backported revision include sql update in form that can be re-apply without problem mutiply times
then:

1. Rename sql update from master form (6939_01_mangos_quest_template.sql) to mangos-0.12 form (001_6939_01_mangos_quest_template.sql)
   using next free order_number in sql/updates files list.
2. Drop sql order guards from sql update file
3. Restore field name in db version table in db sql file (mangos.sql/etc) to state before related revision backporting.
4. Fix/update sql update file name in slq/updates/Makefiel.am

If revison modify table structure and include sql update that can't be applied to db multiply times then please
NOT backport like revisoons.
